#Game Design Document – Under the Radar

##Story
Water is scarce. Your drone has been sent to find it. Pirates’ drones have been sent to steal it. Your drone has spent its day rolling through the desert collecting, and now you must guide it to you.  Power for your little sphere is limited, and both you and the pirates are conserving energy, hiding in the desert.  You and your opponents ping in the desert to see what everyone’s current position is, but otherwise everyone is blindly looking for each other.

##Characters
 * Your water collection sphere is the main character you see.  It has found what it was looking for, gathered it, and is coming home.
 * Your vehicle is also on the board.  Also a sphere, it is designed to protect you and your resources from marauding interlopers.
 * The pirates’ spheres are rolling towards yours.  Moving as fast as they can to intercept your sphere on its way to safety, they will take what you need if they can, and ruin your sphere in the process.

##Level / Environment Design
In this desert, there are rocks, and not much else.  Your environment is stark, and you need to take what you can from it.
##Game Play
Your sphere is rolling more slowly than interlopers’, due to carrying its payload. You need to bring it home as quietly and quickly as possible.  Each time you transmit a radar ping from your sphere to see where it is, and where your enemies are, they see you.  They can also ping you.
Use the arrow keys and limit your transmissions, because you can hide from them and evade them between the pings.
##Art
The art is fairly low-poly, simplistic objects.  The stones are somewhat rounded obstacles.
##Sound / Music
The sound is supposed to be extremely basic.  Low tech bleeps and boops.
##User interface / Game Controls
Arrow keys for back and forth in two dimensions.
